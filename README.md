- 👋 Hi, I’m @Richieg006
- 👀 I’m interested in learning so much more (SQL, Python, BI, etc...) but especially in developing my skills in data and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and have done a bit of SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects currently to learn how to scrape n scrub data before I delve into other areas of my development.
- 📫 How to reach me ... connect with me here.

This is an outline of how I approach projects in a systematic consistent way

Project Title  <-- A quick title to summerise what the aim of the project and question is

Demo Link  <-- A demonstration of the project in action

Table of Contents  <-- Quick links to the rest of the project

Business Connection  <-- How does the project link to industry. What are the key questions and aims of the project. Are there specific requirements?

Data Sourcing  <-- Where did the data come from and what was the rationale and process behind the collection and compilation?

Evidence  <-- screenshots of the process on design and build

Technologies  <-- What technologies have been used in the project

Usage  <--Technical aspects and requirements of how it can be used and any pre-requisits 

Approach  <-- Description of the data analytical cycle and each of the stages. This can be used as an iterative process of refinement on future projects and measure of validity for third parties viewing the project

Status <-- Active, half-baked or disbanded

Credits  <-- Thumbs up for any and all who contributed to the projects
